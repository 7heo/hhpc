hhpc
====

This is a clone of the hhpc program from *xmonad-utils*. I found that after a while for some reason
hhpc stopped hiding my mouse pointer, so I recreated it in C so as to be able to debug it better.

I guess one of the main advantages would be that you don't need haskell-platform to compile and run it,
just gcc, the X11 development libraries, pkg-config and make.
