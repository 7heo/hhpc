hhpc
====

This is a clone of the hhp program from xmonad-utils. I found that after a while for some reason the original hhp stopped hiding my mouse pointer, so I recreated it in C so as to be able to debug it better.

I guess one of the main advantages would be that you don't need haskell-platform to compile and run it, just gcc, the X11 development libraries, pkg-config and make. Also you'll save about 750kb of memory. The idle time is also configurable instead of fixed.

Running
=======

./hhpc <options>

  -i <seconds>: amount of time to wait before hiding the cursor
  -v: be verbose

Runtime Dependencies
====================

A running X server.

Build dependencies
==================

- X.org development files
- A gcc-compatible compiler (haven't tested if the flags works with other compilers)
- pkg-config

NOTE: this code compiles by default with the `-std=c99` switch, for
standards-compliance. This standard was implemented completely as of gcc
4.5, but has been quite functional for a long time before that. So chances
are it will compile just fine. However, since hhpc doesn't use any advanced
C99 features, it will probably compile with much older versions of gcc as
well, though I haven't tried. So if you have an ancient compiler and the
build fails, just edit the Makefile and try leaving out the `-std=c99` flag.

Building
========

To get the dependencies on a debian/ubuntu/...-derivative, simply perform:

$ sudo apt-get install make pkg-config gcc libc6-dev libx11-dev

then after cloning this repo, cd into its directory and execute:

$ make release

if everything goes well, there should appear a hhpc executable in the current directory.

Todo
====

- Use XCB instead of Xlib.
